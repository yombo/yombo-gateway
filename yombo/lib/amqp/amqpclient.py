.. note::

  * For library documentation, see: `AMQP @ Library Documentation <https://yombo.net/docs/libraries/amqp>`_

All AMQP connetions are managed by this library. To create a new connection use the
:py:meth:`self._AMQP.new() <AMQP.new>` function to create a new connection. This will return a
:class:`AMQPClient` instance which allows for creating exchanges, queues, queue bindings,
and sending/receiving messages.

To learn more about AMQP, see the `RabbitMQ Tutorials <https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html>`_.

Yombo Gateway interacts with Yombo servers using AMQPYombo which depends on this library.

.. seealso::

   The :doc:`mqtt library </lib/mqtt>` can connect to MQTT brokers, this a light weight message broker.
