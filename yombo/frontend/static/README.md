# STATIC

This directory contains static static files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in
[the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static).

# Don't touch

Essentially, don't touch these files unless you know what you are doing.

# nuxt.env & sw.js

These file automatically generated by the gateway when it starts, or by the
frontend build process.

# robots.txt

This file is used to tell search engines to essentially go away.
