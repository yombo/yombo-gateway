class Job(object):
    """
    Hold the details of a job that is being, or will be, processed by a ResizableDispatchQueue.

    All jobs start out in the PENDING state. Then either of the following
    will eventually happen:

      1. The job is launched. State is set to UNDERWAY.
      2. The job is cancelled (self.cancel is called) without being
         launched.  The state is then set to CANCELLED.

    Once a job is UNDERWAY, the following may happen:

      1. The function that launches the job hits an error of some
         kind. State goes to FAILED.
      2. The job completes cleanly. State goes to FINISHED.
      3. The job (or, equivalently, the deferred that will receive the
         result) is cancelled. State is set to CANCELLED.

    In rough ASCII art the possible job state transitions are:

                               ->  FAILED
                              /
      PENDING  -->  UNDERWAY  -->  FINISHED
         |                    \
         ----------------------->  CANCELLED


    @ivar jobarg: The argument that will be passed to the function that
    processes the job.

    @ivar priority: The priority for the job. Lower means more important.

    @ivar queuedTime: The time the job entered the queue.

    @ivar startTime: The time processing on the job starts.

    @ivar stopTime: The time job processing stops. Processing stops due to
    one of: clean completion (state = FINISHED), failure during the
    processing (state = FAILED), or job cancellation (state = CANCELLED).

    @ivar finishedDeferred: a C{Deferred} that will fire when the job
    finished, with the job function result.

    @ivar state: The current state of the job, as described above.
